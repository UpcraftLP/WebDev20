# API Endpoints - Version 1



All endpoints are relative to the base API route (`/api/v1`).

The response will always be a JSON-object, indicating the response HTTP status, as well as a `message` field if the status is not `200 - OK`.

 - for **GET**-type endpoints:
   Parameters indicate URI parameters, that are to be appended as query components.
   Example: `GET /api/posts?page=3&sort=latest`
 - for **POST**-type endpoints:
   All parameters are to be added as top-level members of the JSON body element. The `Content-Type` header __must__ be set to `application/json` or the server will reject the API call with `400 - Bad Request`.
   If the client does not need additional information, it should send an empty JSON object as the request body.
